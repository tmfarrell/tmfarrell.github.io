Data engineer/ manager (and sometimes scientist) with interests at the intersection of medicine/ health 
and computation/ automation.  


I believe the application of engineering to biology and medicine is 
the next big phase in technological progress, and will ultimately transform human health and longevity. 
And that data and software will be critical to making that process easier and more effective. 


I write here occasionally to make sense of things. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:tfarrell01@gmail.com)
