Biomedical/ bioinformatics engineer with interests at the intersection of bioeng/ biomedicine/ health 
and computation/ automation. 


I'm interested in working on both software and wetware. In the end, I want to make bioengineering/
biomedicine/ health easier and more effective. And I'm prepared to practice whatever skills necessary. 


I write here occasionally to make sense of what I read/ think. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:tfarrell01@gmail.com) 
with feedback or comments. See [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/Resume, Tim Farrell (BE; 2017).pdf) for my resume,
