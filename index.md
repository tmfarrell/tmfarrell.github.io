I believe the application of engineering/ tech to biology/ medicine/ health will transform human health and longevity. I also believe that [computer/ data science will be critical to making this happen](https://a16z.com/2017/06/21/jorge-conde-bio-fund/).

I write here to try to make sense of things.
