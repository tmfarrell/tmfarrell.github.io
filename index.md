Bio/ bioinformatics/ biomedical engineer operating in Boston. 

My interests lie at the intersection of computation/ automation, engineering 
and biomedicine/ bioeng. I'm equally interested in computational/ software and wetwork/ 
hardware (and ideally combining them). Mainly, I want to make "biostuff", not 
specific to any one level of the <a href="{{ "/writing/2016/10/21/on_the_nature_and_order_of_things.html"
| prepend: site.baseurl}}">biological hierarchy</a>, that works and is useful. And 
I'm prepared to practice whatever skills necessary to do this. 

I use this/ writing to find out what I might really think of things that read/ think. The publishing
aspect really just ensures I give this process the attention it's due. 

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:tfarrell01@gmail.com) with comments/ feedback. See 
[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/Resume (as of NOV16).pdf) if you happen to be interested in 
my resume.
