Biomedical/ bioinformatics engineer with interests at the intersection of bioeng/ biomedicine/ health 
and computation/ automation. 


Ultimately, I want to advance bioengineering/ medicine/ health by making it easier and more effective. 
And am prepared to practice whatever skills necessary to do this.
