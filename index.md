Biomedical/ bioinformatics engineer with interests at the intersection of biomedicine/ bioeng 
and computation/ automation. 

I'm equally interested in working on software and wetware. Mainly, I want to make bioengineering/
biomedicine easier and more effective. And I'm prepared to practice whatever skills necessary to do this.
