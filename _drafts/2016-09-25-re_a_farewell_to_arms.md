Sad thing, war is. But doubly sad is a rejection of it, in the face of it. 

This is what Hemingway seems to mean with this. And it could be summarized 
in the following modern way: 

You're either a lover or you're a fighter. And seems we can all, to a certain
degree, make this choice. But whichever you are, you can not escape the sadness,
the brutality, the disappointment, the lonliness of life. 

Choose honor, integrity and soldierly, and you end up ultimately being subjected
to defeat. At which point, you may then be subject to execution by your fellow 
countrymen. Or if not defeated, and consistently victorious, you end up a vain
selfish bore of a man, thinking only of himself and his accolades. 

Choose love, peace and dishonor, however, and it's not looking to good on that
front either. Sure it might be good to start, and it might feel good
for a while but you can't assume it will be sunshine and rainbows the whole time
through. Good times come back to haunt you, and to collect. 

Both of these paths (Hemingway happens to focus on the choice of the latter, 
and in doing so it seems in a way advocate for the former), it 

It's dirty and rotten and unfair this equilibrium-type business of Nature.
