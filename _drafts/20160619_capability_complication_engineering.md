When systems' (of machinery, of thought, of language) capabilities (or power) 
increase, which one would assume would make the solving of problems easier; 
this often times leads to increased difficulty in solving problems. 

[insert xcdc on automation]

Greater capability necessarily leads to greater complication, which presents
difficulty in applying the system properly/effectively in problem solving. 

"Making problems more difficult than they have to be." We all have 
experiences of this. Of situations, where simpler and, yes, weaker systems
would have solved problems more easily than what was proposed. The term we
use is "over-thinking". 

And this makes some of us sad. B/c maybe the system we made were powerful (and 
beautiful) and applied to all of these cases/conditions in interesting ways.
And these would be those of us generalists, mathematicians, whom wish to 
work in infinites. 

But we shouldn't all be this way. We shouldn't all be interested in building 
the most general, most powerful sytems. This is narrow-minded; we can be 
successful in other ways. 

There is value in less-powerful systems, ones that only solves a limited 
subset of problems (i.e. have less capability). B/c in addition easier to 
work with/ more effective for a substrata of problems, and this is the kicker 
folks, they also take less time to complete. So if we complete more of such 
solutions we could potentially achieve just as great (maybe even greater, 
depending on our work ethic) effect than if we spent all our time on one 
general solution.

[And the other bit here is that there's much more risk in attempting more
general solutions, b/c they are necessarily harder. We don't all need to go
for the most high risk, most high reward options. Again, there are other ways
of being more successful.]

This is the engineering mindset, effectively. [The best example I think of who
exemplifies this mindset is, you guessed it, Richard Hamming of error-correcting
code (and other) fame] So, engineers, don't be tempted (too much) by generality, 
only use it when the situation permits, don't mind leaving it to the mathematicians.

And, mathematicians, by all means don't mind snooping down to the level of mortals
to solve problems of a shorter time domain.
