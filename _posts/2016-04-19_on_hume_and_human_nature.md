Came across this excerpt in the intro to David Hume's **Treatise on Human Nature**. He's got a great point here, one that scientists/ engineers/ technical-types sometimes forget.

>It is evident, that all the sciences have a relation, greater or less, to human nature: and that however wide any of them may seem to run from it, they still return back by one passage or another. Even Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Natural Religion, are in some measure dependent on the science of MAN; since they lie under the cognizance of men, and are judged of by their powers and faculties. It is impossible to tell what changes and improvements we might make in these sciences were we thoroughly acquainted with the extent and force of human understanding, and could explain the nature of the ideas we employ, and of the operations we perform in our reasonings. 

The practice of math and science is indeed inherently a product of human nature.  (In fact, it could be argued it's the *most human* product of our nature.)

So STEM may not be as cold-calculating as it's set out to be.  It's as natural to being human as anything else.  And with that subject to our common flaws. 

Important to recognize this regularly, to avoid fooling ourselves (the easiest to fool).
