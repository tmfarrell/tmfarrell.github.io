There are good reasons for the recent public critiques of the product management function in tech. Product leaders have gotten to wrapped up in [productivity theater](https://www.fastcompany.com/90913945/how-to-tell-team-participating-productivity-theater). 

Product is not about applying the latest framework, or implementing the right process. **Product is about producing**.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> Specifically, it's about producing something that satisfies a need or desire in a market. 

And the art of producing is not new, or unique to the tech industry.  


### Producing 0 => 1

#### Be Creative

In film and music--where products are constantly being created from scratch—the role of a producer is a creative one. Not just steering projects from concept to completion, but actively contributing to the creative process. 

In music especially, producers are true artists, overseeing everything from pre to post-production; transforming raw sound into polished musical compositions. Film producers have a similar role. 

Because of this, you can always tell a Guy Ritchie film or [a track produced by 40](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CkhmUfZAzbE/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) by their distinct style. It's part of why their work wins.  

In tech, product decisions should be made with some mix of data and intuition. Typically 0 => 1 environments are data poor though, so intuition and creativity become more important.<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>  Building at this stage then should be more like music/ film  producing, not only orchestrating the process but also creating within it.


#### Have Final Cut

Unfortunately, data poor environments also leave decisions open to criticism and creative disagreement. When decisions can't made objectively, opinions feel like they have an open invite. 

However, this is also not new, or unique to the tech industry. This is why film directors and producers are granted ["final cut"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_cut_privilege). They have the vision for the final output and final say as to what the should look like. 

A similar policy should be instituted in product teams building 0 => 1. Opinions shouldn't have equal weight. A single person--whether it be the CEO or the product lead--should have final say on the vision and what the final output should look like. 


### Scaling Production

#### The Goal

For products that have already achieved some success, it’s less about creativity and more about growth.

Drawing inspiration from Eliyahu Goldratt's [“The Goal”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goal_(novel)), any business can be thought of as a production line. 

For tech products, the production line is the growth funnel (marketing + sales): the process of producing purchasing customers from fresh prospects. The goal at this stage is to eliminate bottlenecks, increase throughput and drive sales.

Data becomes much more important. It should give a more objective sense of where the bottlenecks are and, at a certain scale, experiments can be used to determine how best to fix them. 


### Just Produce

To sum up: **Product is about producing, pure and simple.** 

Forget the latest framework or that "hot take" on Twitter. Tools are only as good as the end result. Picasso wasn't great because of his paint brushes. 

Be more creative and intuitive at early stage. Optimize production in later stages. 

Whatever you do, produce.

<a name="f1">[1]</a>  It’s no coincidence _product_ and _producer_ share the same Latin root “produco”, which means “to lead forth” or “bring to light.” [[Return]](#a1) 

<a name="f1">[2]</a>  Which isn't to say you shouldn't use data at all. At early stage you should gather as much customer insights as possible to deeply understand their problems and underserved needs. [[Return]](#a2)
