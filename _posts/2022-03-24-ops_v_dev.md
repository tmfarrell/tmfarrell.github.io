*Note: this post is mostly about software or digital products , but the general principles apply in some way to all types of products.*

### Product Operations

Product operations, or "product ops", has in recent years been used to describe the work to operationalize the feedback loop between product, engineering and customer success[[1]](https://www.pendo.io/glossary/product-operations/). I actually think this is, in essence, operationalizing the product management function, and so would be better termed "product management ops"; or, since it relies heavily on data, "product analytics".

The way I'm using product operations here is: **manual or semi-automated processes the team has to perform to directly serve customers, as part of value delivery.** For some products, the operational component is larger than others. Say, when the product is more like a service, or if the product is a technical product at an earlier/ less mature/ R&D stage (like with early stage AI or data products).

### DevOps, Technical Debt and Development

There is a correlation/ relationship between technical debt and operations (i.e. manual processes) performed by the engineering team: the more technical debt a product has, the larger the operational component. However, I wouldn't consider these *product* operations but rather *development* operations, or DevOps, since these operations don't directly support customers.

One specific example is if the development team doesn't yet have CI/CD set up and so the code deployment process is manual and cumbersome: this is technical debt that leads to increased operational load on the dev team. Product operations are more like operations where manual processes have to take place to fulfill a customer request, in a service-like scenario.

Development work then is work done by the engineering team to improve the product, either by adding (or improving) product features or by addressing technical debt. The goal of technical debt work is to reduce DevOps burden (sometimes called toil), while the goal of feature work, sometimes called "on-product" work, is to increase your product's value for customers.

### On-Product versus Technical Debt Trade-off

One of the major tradeoffs that product managers, scrum masters and/ or general managers (depending on how your team is organized) have to make is deciding between addressing technical debt and adding new features ("on-product" work).

The best approach I've come across for thinking about this tradeoff is to agree up-front with the team on an "on-product index", that is a proportion of tickets (or development time) that will be dedicated to improving the product. And this index should vary by what stage of development your company is in.

For example, if your product is at an early stage of development (i.e. pre-product market fit) you want a high on-product index bc at that stage you should be focused on learning what your customers actually want (or what the product should be) as opposed to trying to make it more scalable (or reducing technical debt). Once the product is at a later stage (i.e. post-PMF) then the on-product index should likely be lower as you focus on making the product scalable and more easily maintainable.

### Product = Revenue Independent of Time

For products with more of an operational component, one of the additonal tradeoffs that has to be made is: how do we prioritize between product operations versus development that improves the product? Very similar to the technical debt tradeoff, except here operations are directly supporting customers and potential revenue (if the company is at that stage).

The ideal product actually has no operational component (i.e. is completely automated), since **what you want is a product's revenue to be independent of time**. This is what it means for a product to be scalable.

In this framing, the highest priority of the development team should be to first automate product operations so to make revenue independent of time. And only then to engage in the technical debt tradeoff, which is a slightly easier tradeoff to make since it doesn't directly tie to revenue.

If product operations are so high volume/ time-consuming, the team should probably hire a dedicated resource for product operations, treating that as a product operating cost. The goal then should be to eventually redirect those operating costs towards development and product improvements as the level of automation increases.
