First, if you haven't already checked out Guy Raz's ["How I Built This"](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this), 
definitely give it listen. Excellent stuff. 

It's different from, say, a ["Master of Scale"](https://mastersofscale.com/) becuase he usually presents 
stories on founders/ companies outside the Silicon Valley mold. Maybe they were successful, but 
made a conscious effort not to get too big. Maybe they didn't seek outside investment in exchange 
for more control of their company. Maybe they chose to be a force for social good, rather than a 
pure profit-maximization machine. 

What's most interesting about many of the stories though (and in retrospect this is probably mostly
true of the stories in "Master of Scale" as well) is that at some point in the life cycle of an
idea when it gets to the point of being fully fleshed out and instantiated in a fully functioning
company, and it gains enough traction and space in the world, it takes on a life of its own. And 
oftentimes the founders will take a backseat role, or cash out. And the company will live on, alot 
of times even without the knowledge of the company's customers. 

As Ben said on the [Ben & Jerry's episode](https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=562899429:564777542), 
"Most people think we're dead."  

And even further, sometimes the founders dislike what the company has become. 

How/ why does this occur? You would think that the creator and owner of business should be able to
not only control it, but shut it down if things aren't going the direction they intended. 

The problem, of course, is a problem of scale. Once a company gets big enough, it becomes a cultural
object, at a higher level than the indivduals whom created it. It becomes a natural force in society. 
It's developed its own ecosystem internally, and found its niche in the marketplace ecology.

And biological analogies are helpful here. The building of a business really is like the growing/ evolving of
an organism. 

When we get an idea, or we build a business into a big idea/ image/ brand, we build a mental object
(ultimately an instantiation of the resources-processes-values (RPV) framework<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>)
that can be communicated to, and propagated through, other people. At that point, it becomes something like
a virus. Some get infected (i.e. convinced) very easily, others are immune. 

If we take this analogy further, we realize that indeed not only is this mental object that we
build *like* a biological entity, it *is* a biological entity. Its one that inhabits human brains,
that may or may not influence their behavior. (Do they buy your product? Do they hire you?) 

When we realize this, we also realize that a good idea should be like a virus. When we have a good idea, 
it should feel like we're sick with it. It should feel so *inhabiting* that it'd be better if we acted on it 
(i.e. we transmitted to other individuals) rather than live with it. This is why sometimes you'll hear 
founders, or even writers, say something like "It was almost easier that I built/ wrote it, so I could stop
thinking about it". 

A good idea should feel like it has a life of its own. It should want to live and grow solely for the sake of life 
and growth, just like genes/ DNA. Those fortunate enough to get infected with a good idea are merely vehicles. 

And this should be embraced to a degree. Treat an idea/ company like you would a garden, or a child. 
You're responsible for the watering, the providing for, but you shouldn't give it less credit than 
it deserves. If we set it up for succeess, it will grow big and powerful, ideally much more so than 
the individual whom created it. (Which explains why oftentimes, after a long enough period of growth, 
the founders feel they have to step out the way and let it live on it own.)  

Anther implication of this line of thinking is: to get infected with an idea, is not a unique or 
special phenomenon. It is a biological/ cultural process that strikes individuals who happen to be at 
particular places, at a particular time, with a particular knowledge set. And with more and more humans in 
the world, with more access to information than ever before, it's likely that at any given time someone else is 
probably getting the idea you have. And maybe even working on making it a reality. <sup id="a1">[2](#f2)</sup>
