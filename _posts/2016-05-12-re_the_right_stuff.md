Swag.  
Class.  
Style.  
Quality.   
Swagger.   
The Juice.  
The Magic.  
The Business.  
The Right Stuff.   
The Midas Touch.  
The Oft-Imitated, Never-Replicated.   
That Which You Know When You See It.  
That Which Counts But Cannot Easily Be Counted. 

Some say you either have it or you don't. 

But in fact "The Right Stuff" (Tom Wolfe) is really just a discussion of how 
the astronauts that have the so-called have "right stuff" really just have 
done everything right.

And it's as simple as that. They in actuality "can do no wrong" b/c they've in 
actuality done no wrong. 

And this applies to everything, every aspect of their person: their performance, 
their personality (especially), their politico. Every thing matters, and one
false step, one mistiming and suddenly they don't have it. They're washed up, 
all excuses, all flash no thunder. 

[In this case, which complicates my argument a bit (but I would argue from a 
subjective standpoint not much), timing is actually critical b/c, alas, the
first astronaut sent into orbit can only happen once in history. With these
sorts of historic/time-sensitive events, it's hard to apply the following
attitude (b/c if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, then really 
that's what you're doing wrong) in every endevour. But I would argue that it's 
generally reliable (since if you're working at doing the right things, you'll
position yourself in the right time at the right place).]

And so with this, it seems the degree to which a person does the right things, 
makes no missteps, says the right sayings at the right timings, is proportional
to their possession of "that righteous stuff". 

In effect then if one increases this degree one increases the righteousness
of their stuff, or the amount of their righteous stuff, or the proportion to
which their stuff is righteous (or whatever).

So this can be worked at. Yes, it depends on how "right" you are to begin with, 
but there are certainly ways to reduce the amount that you are wrong generally, 
and increase the amount you are right (or vice versa). 

So work in can mean stuff out. 

And so this then becomes analogous to the talent versus "everything else" 
question. Where I'll devert to this post here, for the relevant arguments. 

To summarize, bottomline: Want it. Work for it. And you will have it. (Given
that you include the timing/placing bit in this whole process as well.)
