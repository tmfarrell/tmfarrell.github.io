A better biological fact is a more general biological fact. 

Unfortunately, traditionally speaking, generality has not been medicine or biology's forte. In 
the more "informational"/formal sciences---computer science, math, statistics, even physics---the 
more general your contribution, the more widely respected. But it's always seemed as though 
biology/ medicine, at their outsets, inverted this relationship. Biologists have been more 
concerned with naming new species, or finding new unique biological marcomolecules or processes. 
You can see this in any cursory study of molecular biology. The absence of any sort of 
organization in the naming of molecular biological machinery is pretty baffling. 

Similarly, for physicians, it has seemed like they are more concerned with developing specific procedures,
or studying specific cases or case studies, or finding rare genetic mutations responsible for disease. Rather
than trying to devise a more general theory of treatment, or disease prevention.  

However, we can imagine examples in the history of biology/ medicine where generality has played a 
big part. Back when anatomical classification was in its heydey, it might have been more exciting 
to find common anatomical features between species than to find differences. To find that birds 
or reptiles or other vertebrates had the same fundamental internal organization as humans, that's 
powerful. 

Then, more recently, there was the discovery of DNA, RNA and the central dogma. The very reason 
this was exciting/ useful was because it applied (i.e. could be generalized) to **all** living organisms. 
Indeed, the central dogma is the very basis for life itself. 

Now that biology and medicine are increasing becoming information sciences, as well as more concerned
with being applied and useful, the name of the game will more and more become *generalizability*. 

Why? 

For one, generalizability is oftentimes proportional to utility. By definition, the more general
some fact is, the greater the number of specific facts it applies to. This is often because 
general statements are more abstract, stripped of their specific details and left only with their
essential features. 

(Although, this doesn't always need be the case. The central dogma is fairly specific in its description. 
More or less, it works the same way in all organisms. The differences between its specific instantiations
in different types of organisms pales in comparison to its commonalities. 

What makes the central dogma general is the fact that it occurs at a lower level of the biological
heirarchy, so it applies to all higher levels. And similiarly it was evolved at the earliest stages 
of life, so it supports and applies to all later stages of life.

So generality can also mean deeper, or earlier/ historical, facts.)

As biology and medicine become more and more concerned with application, I'd argue that it's more
and more important to seek out the utility of generality. As we have seen from the application of 
those more formal sciences, the value of formality and with it generality, gives the straightforwardness 
of application and utility. For this reason, we should strive to be more general, not more specific 
or stratified, in biology/ medicine/ biotechnology. 

A more general biology will undoubtedly result in a better biology. And a better, healthier human race.
