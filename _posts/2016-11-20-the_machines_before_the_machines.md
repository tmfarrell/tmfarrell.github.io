*This is an argument for biology as a viable medium for engineering.*

## Biology Is Soft

Biology has failed (I think) to find a central paradigm, a general framework for thinking about organisms/ 
living things. Especially, for the purposes of building up biology to be more of a hard science, to making
it more like its more formal counterparts, which translate well to the applied domain. 

Sure, we have the central dogma: DNA \\( \to \\) RNA \\( \to \\) Protein; which is something. It give us a 
high-level picture of how biological systems work generally, and implies how they've come to be in the 
first place. 

But if we're being honest, it is really just a sketch. And it's too specific. It's not formalized, it's not general. If we want to make biology harder, so its applied domains have a platform to really stand on; it 
must have some more formality, and it must be more general. 

For instance, another example, the theory of evolution. This is hands-down the central paradigm of biology (making the dogma a close second). It is so useful, one scientist famously remarked, "Nothing in biology 
makes sense, except in light of evolution." 

And yet, the theory is soft, too. Where's the mathematics? When can we have mathematics that justify
the building of synthetic systems that have the capacity for evolution, and to optimize this process, etc.
Biology just isn't there yet, and undoubtedly the answer has to be mathemetics, as it's the most effective
language we have (but maybe it's not the type of typical mathematics everyone is used to<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>).

## Machines Before The Machines

The naysayers whom may doubt that biology can become as hard as its more formal counterparts (physics and
chemistry) may be right. Chemistry is less formal than physics. So it only seems a logical progression
that biology would be less formal than chemistry. This may be unavoidable. 

But the way I see it, biology, the study of biological organisms, is much like the studying of automobiles. 
Yes, cars, organisms are like cars. Except ones we ourselves haven't built so we don't completely 
understand how they work. We've examined their components and systems enough to know in good detail how
they work and how to fix them if they're broken (usually). But for the most part, we are clueless when it 
comes to how to *build* and *design* them. (Ideally, how to build and design them better.)

Now, we're getting closer. The highly-touted CRISPR is getting us to a place where we can alter the 
blueprints to improve the end machinery. This is a big improvement. But it's only scratching the surface. 

Again, we should remember that, in truth, biological systems are the real machines. They were the machines
before there were the kinds of machines we think of as machines, before there were cars/etc, before we
made them. And the power/ value in a machine is that it can convert different forms of energy into one 
another; it's in the transducers and the converters, etc. It's in *doing valued work*.

And that with respect to biological systems it shouldn't just be about genetically altering to make small 
changes, to eliminate deficiences, etc. But in using the theories of biology (again, in more formal forms), 
to genetically engineer powerful little biological systems that trully harness the power/ value of their 
machinic nature.

<a name="f1">1.</a> It's been argued that the most viable candidate for a mathematics suitable for
the formalization of biology is so-called post-modern mathematics. And I happen to agree I think that
theoretical computer science has much to offer biology in the way of formality. I mean, theories of trees, 
learning and language, what more do folks as proof of promise?
