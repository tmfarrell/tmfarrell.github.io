Working at a startup is kinda like you’re in some kind of rally car trying to win some kind of race, 
where the destination/ finish line is unknown, the specific directions unclear and your potential 
speed virtually limitless. 

But the faster you go the more fuel you use and you only have a limited amount of fuel (your 
fuel tank's only so big). So maybe you keep some fuel cans in reserve, or maybe some companies give 
you free fuel along the way, in exchange for putting some ads on your car. Or maybe you use that 
otherwise reserve fuel to boost your speed for a while, leaving none in reserve and you having to 
stop for more. 

But, since the destination's unknown, even if you decide to move faster it’s not clear you’re going 
in the right or wrong direction more quickly. And, even more, since you’re human your tolerance for 
speed is also limited: you might get sick from the turbulence or afraid of a 
crash.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> So basically you go as fast as you and your vehicle can tolerate.

For some reason, I envision this as some kind of scene from an old Charlie Chaplin film where’s 
there’s no sound and it’s slapstick all the way: he’s running around in this Model T looking thing 
driving as fast as he can on this muddy, bumpy road stopping every once and a while to get out and
fill up using a fuel can, spilling and tripping as he does. It’s alot like that. Except, 
of course: startups aren’t Model T’s, they can go as fast you can tolerate. And also it's not that 
funny. 

And this is all also a simplification, because you’re usually not focused on a single 
race,<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> you’re really thinking about a handful of races. And you 
have some fleet of vehicles, each with limited fuel, drivers and all the rest. And, even more, there 
are an almost infinite number of potential races you can join, but you have to find them, 
in some cases pay some fee to enter, and then go through all the operational/ logistical hurdles to 
get your vehicles to some starting point (which again is vague and unspecific) with proper fuel, 
drivers and all the rest. 

Oh and by the way, there’s no official start to these races. They only start *for you* when *you* start 
them, but they've typically started for everyone else already and you don’t know how far ahead the others
are because you can't see them as they're scattered along "the route". And, even more, even if you 
could, you don’t know precisely where the finish is anyway so it's difficult to tell who's ahead. 

In short, it’s a challenging and tricky business trying to make something new into something 
valuable.
