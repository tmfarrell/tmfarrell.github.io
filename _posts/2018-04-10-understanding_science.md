Understanding a scientific talk or paper is difficult business. Not only 
because the concepts can often be counterintuitive or unsettling. But also
because even scientific talks/ papers (depending the field's expected level
of rigor) can be riddled with errors and ambiguities.  

Moreover, these errors can occur at 2 different levels and, because of the 
proximity/ relatedness of these 2 levels, it's tough to know which one any 
given error/ ambiguity belongs to. 

Scientific error occurs either at (a) the level of language or (b) the level of logic. 

Language is the level concerned with the keywords and syntax that make up statements.  

Logic is the level concerned with how statements relate to one another, how 
they are ordered and how they combine together into a well-formed argument or claim. 

Language deals with sentences and logic deals with sets of sentences (and sets 
of sets of sentences, etc.).

Errors of language occur with ambigious or ill-defined terms, vague/
imprecise descriptors/ values, spelling/ grammatic inconsistency and so on.

Logic errors occur at a deeper level and can be more difficult to identify,
since they often sit underneath layers of language errors. Once all language 
errors are corrected, those that remain are logical. 

A logic error occurs when you take a set of clean statements together, 
work out how they relate to one another and what they imply, and find the 
conclusion contradictory or fallacious. 

Now, as mentioned, the real difficulty arises becsuse of how closely related
language and logic are. 

With programming/ formal languages, how languages are defined dictate how 
the logic of that language works. This is also true with less formal languages,
like scientific language, though the relation between language and logic is less
precisely defined.   

Along this vein, scientific papers are less formal equivalents of computer programs
and mathematical proofs. A true mathematical proof can still be bad. A working program
can still be unreadable. Their logic can be sound but their language unelegant and 
sloppy. Similarly, a false mathematical proof can be completely bogus (i.e. fallacious). 

When debugging a computer program, assuming ample amounts of time, I'd argue that it's
more important to start with correcting language errors first. Are you using the keywords 
correctly? Is the syntax error-free? Are you naming things in an easily-understood manner? 
(That last one is easily the most difficult to get right. Analogous to picking base axioms 
to start with in a mathematical proof.)

Once those are taken care of, then you tackle the logic. Is the program really doing what
you want it to? Does the output at every step make sense? (This can also be pretty difficult
if you don't know what "truth" is.)

The goal of crafting any scientific talk/ paper, then, should be to to get the 
language clean and error-free first. Formalize (i.e. mathematize) it as needed 
depending on the subtlety of the section (e.g. certain parts of the methods
should be made as formal as possible). Then focus on making the logic make sense.
