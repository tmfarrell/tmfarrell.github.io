Leaders/ managers have a lot of work. Work that, in order get done on time, will have to be 
distributed or parititioned across those that work for them. This is the exact reason why 
leaders/ managers have people work for them. 

Delegating that work then not only parallelizes work across their reports but also allows 
some degree of variation in how those work partitions get done. Each report does things 
a bit differently.

This is variation involves some risk, because some reports will do the task better and some will do 
it worse. However, over the long run, this risk should be worth taking because it is an opportunity
for learning. 

After all is said and done, those reports who did things differently and better (or differently and 
not worse) can describe **why** they did what they did. They can write down their strategy and this 
then becomes a learning that can be applied across the organization. This is exactly how the concept 
of *best practices* are formed. 

One of the primary goals of organizational leaders and managers then is to set up an environment 
where this learning can be applied effectively and efficiently to all work in their organization. 

This is the cycle:

  1. have similar/ comparable work done by different units, 
  2. assessing results and outcomes produced by those units, 
  3. observe and record learnings from unit mistakes/ successes, and 
  4. copy successful practices across the organization 

Why does this work so well? Because it replicates the most powerful force in the universe: evolution. The 
important piece for organizations, though, is to be diligent about capturing and copying learnings 
(i.e. parts 3 and 4). 

Biology captures and copies automatically by way of natural selection. In human organizations, there's no guarantee 
the right processes are set up to do both capturing and copying well. 

This is the challenge of building a [learning organization](https://hbr.org/1993/07/building-a-learning-organization), 
and is one of the main responsibilities of leadership.
