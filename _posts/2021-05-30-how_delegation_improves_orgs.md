Leaders/ managers have a lot of work. Work that, in order get done on time, will have to be 
distributed or parititioned across those that work for them. This is the exact reason why 
leaders/ managers have people work for them. 

Delegating that work then not only parallelizes work across their reports but also allows 
some degree of variation in how those work partitions get done. Each report does things 
a bit differently.

This is variation involves some risk, because some reports will do the task better and some will do 
it worse. However, over the long run, this risk should be worth taking because it is an opportunity
for learning. 

After all is said and done, those reports who did things differently and better (or differently and 
not worse) can describe **why** they did what they did. They can write down their strategy and this 
then becomes a learning that can be applied across the organization. This is exactly how the concept 
of *best practices* are formed. 

One of the primary goals of organizational leaders and managers then is to set up an environment 
where this learning can be applied effectively and efficiently to all work in the organization. 

This is the loop: (a) similar work done by different parties, (b) assessment of results, (c) learnings 
from mistakes/ successes and (d) copying practices that led to success. 

Why should this work so well? Because it mimicks the most powerful process known to man: evolution. 

The catch is that organizations must be diligent about carrying over the selection and copying parts (c and d). 
Biology does this automatically by way of reproduction/ replication, but organizations could have very bad
documentation and learning practices.
