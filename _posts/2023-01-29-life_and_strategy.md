## Strategy Seems Complex 

I came across this HBR article recently--[Use Strategic Thinking to Create the Life You Want](https://hbr.org/2023/12/use-strategic-thinking-to-create-the-life-you-want)--which introduced an interesting concept: use best practices of business strategy  to improve your life. 

They listed out a 7-step process though, so no way I was making it through the full article, way too long. 

Like why _seven_ steps? What an odd and annoying number. Not only that, but they were all very open-ended and ill-defined. Ain't nobody got time for that.  

Clearly the authors took a typical MBA-type approach: overly complicated, aesthetically displeasing and less "usable" as a result. 


## But It Doesn't Have to Be

I believe the core of their idea (and strategy in general, for that matter) relies on the "Benchmarking" step encapsulated in the graphic below.

Essentially, the survey results here outline a mathematical model for how life satisfaction correlates with specific, known quantities (i.e. net income, how many friendships, etc.). You don't need to subjectively rank areas by what you think is important. Benchmarking does that for you. 

What the authors didn't realize is that, once you strip away the unnecessary complexity, this is the kernel of a powerful idea: benchmark your life using specific, known quantities and use that to identify areas you'd gain the most satisfaction by improving.

Using this, their approach could be simplified from 7 ill-defined steps to 3 straightforward ones: 

1. **Survey Your Life**: Take a survey about specific, known quantities across the areas of your life. Multiple choice rather than open-ended.  

2. **Benchmark Your Results**: Use the benchmarking models to estimate your relative life satisfaction (RLS) from those specific quantities and compare that to the maximum possible RLS for each area. 

3. **Strategize**: Identify areas where you can gain the most RLS and focus on those. Use specific, known quantities to devise an action plan. 


**Side note:** I've created a simple app that helps you execute this 3-step process, try it out here: [https://strategize-life.streamlit.app/](https://strategize-life.streamlit.app/).    


## "Diagnose-Guide-Act" Strategy Framework

This emphasis on benchmarking also ties in nicely with the strategy framework outlined by Richard Rumelt in "Good Strategy/ Bad Strategy". 

He argues the kernel of a good strategy has 3 elements: 

- **Diagnosis**: Identify the problem that your strategy is meant to solve.  According to Rumelt, this is the most difficult and often neglected element of strategy.  

- **Guiding Policy**: Develop an overarching approach or policy to address the diagnosed challenges. This is a high-level direction to go in, ideally leveraging some power or competitive advantage. 

- **Coherent Action**: Outline a series of coherent steps that align with your guiding policy. These actions should be practical, achievable, and directly contribute to solving the diagnosed problem.

## Benchmarking: A Powerful Aid for Strategy

What I'm realizing is that benchmarking can provide a straightforward path to identifying and diagnosing problems in an organization and in life. 

Measure important things, benchmark them against reference standards and use that to quantify where your biggest problems are. Physicians do this when they measure biomarkers and do imaging when they're trying to diagnose a patient. 

Additionally, benchmarking also provides a way to identify guiding policies, if you know the quantities or metrics you're benchmarking on can be influenced by you or your team. 

Identify where you are weak and where you are strong; then leverage your strengths to improve your weaknesses. Or, an equally viable approach, double down on your strengths. Then all you have to do is come up with an action plan to execute that policy. 

It seems like, with a focus on benchmarking, strategy doesn't have to be as hard as it seems. If you have specific measures you can benchmark and those are influencable by your actions, it seems like that's the best place to start.

### A Note on Correlation vs Causation

One weakness with the argument above is that just because a measure (i.e. number of friends) correlates with an outcome (i.e. life satisfaction) doesn't imply that measure directly causes it. That's true, but here's my response. 

Mistaking correlation for causation assumes `A` directly influences `B`: `A -> B`. When in reality it could be that a latent variable `C` influences `A` and `B`: `C -> A` and `C -> B`.  So directly changing `A` won't directly change `B`. 

However, for most things, I think we usually know a `C` or a set of potential things that could be `C` that we can try to change in order to affect both `A` and `B`. 

For example, in life, if you know you're weak at relationships (i.e. `A`) and you know that good relationships correlate with life satisfaction (i.e. `B`) then you can probably think of a handful of things you could be doing to improve your relationship or social skills (i.e. `C`). 

It could be that improving your social skills is really what will increase your life satisfaction (`C -> B`), but, after you do that, does it really matter whether it was your skill improvement or the fact that now have better relationships (`A`)? Either way, you're more satisfied.
