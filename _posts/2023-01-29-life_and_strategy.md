## Strategy Seems Complex 

HBR put out an article recently--[Use Strategic Thinking to Create the Life You Want](https://hbr.org/2023/12/use-strategic-thinking-to-create-the-life-you-want)--introducing an interesting concept: how to use business strategy best practices to improve your life. 

Article was entirely too long though, outlining a 7-step process that underlied their approach. Like why _seven_? What an odd and annoying number. Not only that but all the steps were open-ended and ill-defined.  

Clearly, the authors erred on the side of an overly complicated, MBA-type approach.


## But It Doesn't Have to Be

I believe their approach (and strategy in general, for that matter) can be simplified if you strip it down and focus on the "Benchmarking" step encapsulated in the graphic below.

What the authors didn't realize is that these survey results essentially outline a mathematical model for how life satisfaction correlates with specific, known quantities about a life (i.e. net income, how many friendships, etc.). Which means, you don't need to subjectively rank areas by what you think is important (as they suggest in the article). Benchmarking can do that for you. 

Once you strip away the unnecessary complexity, underneath is the kernel of a powerful idea: benchmark your life using specific, known quantities and use that to identify areas you'd gain the most satisfaction by improving.

Using this, you can simplify 7 ill-defined steps to 3 straightforward ones: 

1. **Survey Your Life**: Take a survey about specific, known quantities across the areas of your life. Multiple choice rather than open-ended.  

2. **Benchmark Your Results**: Use the benchmarking models to estimate your relative life satisfaction (RLS) from those specific quantities and compare that to the maximum possible RLS for each area. 

3. **Strategize**: Identify areas where you can gain the most RLS and focus on those. Use specific, known quantities to devise an action plan. 


**Side note:** I've created a simple app that helps you execute this 3-step process, try it out here: [https://strategize-life.streamlit.app/](https://strategize-life.streamlit.app/).    


## "Diagnose-Guide-Act" Strategy Framework

This emphasis on benchmarking also ties in nicely with the strategy framework outlined by Richard Rumelt in "Good Strategy/ Bad Strategy", where he argues the kernel of a good strategy has 3 elements: 

- **Diagnosis**: Identify and understand deeply the problem your strategy is meant to address.  

- **Guiding Policy**: Develop an overarching approach or policy to address the diagnosis. This is a high-level direction to go in, ideally leveraging some power or competitive advantage. 

- **Coherent Action**: Outline a series of coherent steps that align with your guiding policy. These actions should be practical, achievable, and directly contribute to solving the diagnosed problem.

According to Rumelt, "Diagnosis" is one of the most neglected elements of strategy, partly because it also the most difficult. You need to do deep analysis from many angles to really understand the problem you and/ or your organization are trying to solve. 

## Benchmarking: A Powerful Aid for Strategy

Benchmarking seems to provide a straightforward path to diagnosis: Measure important quantities, benchmark them against standards and use that to identify the causes of your biggest challenges. 

Physicians do this when diagnosing a patient using imaging, biomarkers and physiological measures. They're identifying the root cause of disease. We can do this ourselves to diagnose our organizations and our lives.  

Benchmarking also seems to provide a way to identify guiding policies, if you know the measures you're benchmarking can be influenced by you or your team. 

Identify where you are weak and where you are strong; then determine if you can leverage your strengths to address your weaknesses. Or, an equally viable approach, double down on your strengths. Then come up with an action plan to influence and/ or leverage those measures to execute that policy. 

As long as you have specific, important measures to benchmark and those are influenceable by your actions, it seems like strategy doesn't have to be as complex as it's made to be. It can follow naturally from comparing those quantities to standards and taking action to meet and exceed those standards.

### A Note on Correlation vs Causation

One weakness with the argument above is that just because a measure (i.e. number of relationships) correlates with an outcome (i.e. life satisfaction) doesn't imply that measure directly causes it. That's true, but here's my response. 

Mistaking correlation for causation assumes `A` directly influences `B`: `A -> B`. When in reality it could be that a latent variable `C` influences `A` and `B`: `C -> A` and `C -> B`.  So directly changing `A` won't directly change `B`. 

However, for most things, I think we usually know a `C` or a set of potential things that could be `C` that we can try to change in order to affect both `A` and `B`. 

For example, in life, if you know you're weak at relationships (i.e. `A`) and you know that good relationships correlate with life satisfaction (i.e. `B`) then you can probably think of a handful of things you could be doing to improve your social or relationship skills (i.e. `C`). 

It could be that improving your social skills itself is what really increases your life satisfaction (`C -> B`). But, after the fact, does it really matter whether it was that skill improvement or the better relationships (`A`)? Either way, you're more satisfied.
