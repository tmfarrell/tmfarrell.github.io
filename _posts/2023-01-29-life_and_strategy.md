## Strategy Often Seems Complicated

Harvard Business Review recently published [an interesting article](https://hbr.org/2023/12/use-strategic-thinking-to-create-the-life-you-want) exploring how business strategy principles can enhance personal life. 

However, the author's 7-step process (Why _seven_ steps? Who's got time for that?) and the article's length made it all pretty unusable. I wasn't able to finish the article, let alone apply it to my life. 

The authors' approach seemed overly complicated, typical of an academic perspective (i.e. MBA types). And it seems like this is the default mode strategy is approached in general. 

## It Doesn't Have To Be

A more simple, streamlined approach the "Benchmarking" step highlighted in the article. This simplification revolves around a powerful concept: using benchmarking to evaluate your life using specific, measurable factors.

The overlooked gem in the article is the correlation between life satisfaction and measurable life aspects (like net income, number of friendships, etc.). This correlation allows for an objective assessment of life areas, as opposed to the subjective ranking suggested in the article.

By distilling the original 7 steps into 3 clear actions, you can effectively strategize your life improvement:

1. **Survey Your Life**: Conduct a multiple-choice survey on various life aspects.
   
2. **Benchmark Your Results**: Compare your survey results with models estimating Relative Life Satisfaction (RLS) from these factors, and gauge them against maximum possible RLS in each area.

3. **Strategize**: Identify areas with the most potential RLS gain. Develop a focused action plan to enhance these measurable aspects.

## The "Diagnose-Guide-Act" Strategy Framework

This benchmarking-centric method also aligns well with Richard Rumelt's "Good Strategy/Bad Strategy" framework, comprising three elements:

- **Diagnosis**: Deeply understand the problem at hand.
- **Guiding Policy**: Establish an overarching approach, leveraging strengths or competitive advantages.
- **Coherent Action**: Implement practical, aligned actions to execute on this approach.

Rumelt emphasizes that the 'diagnosis' phase is the most difficult and neglected, requiring thorough analysis from various perspectives to truly grasp the problem.

## Benchmarking: A Tool For Strategy

Benchmarking offers a clear path to diagnosis by measuring key quantities and comparing them to standards, thus identifying challenges and opportunities. This is akin to how physicians diagnose their patients by comparing labs or imaging to what you'd expect in a "normal" or healthy patient.

Furthermore, benchmarking can also inform guiding policies, especially if it highlights strengths or potential competitive advantages. One approach would be to test different policies on a smaller scale before committing to bigger moves or larger investments.

## Strategy and Science

Overall, it seems like strategy can be simplified through measurement and benchmarking, using known quantities for diagnosis and hypothesis validation. 

And this approach isn't novel; it underpins the [Lean Startup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup) movement, which is essentially a more scientific approach to innovation and entrepreneurship. By testing hypotheses early, measuring results of development and iterating, rather than relying on business plans or the entrepreneur's vision.

And this scientific approach doesn't seem to just apply to startups. In an increasingly digital/ online world, all companies want to understand how digital innovation can help them grow. 

Injecting some more science into their strategy may be just what they need.

### A Note on Correlation vs Causation

One weakness with the argument above is that just because a measure (i.e. number of relationships) correlates with an outcome (i.e. life satisfaction) doesn't imply that measure directly causes it. That's true, but here's my response. 

Mistaking correlation for causation assumes `A` directly influences `B`: `A -> B`. When in reality it could be that a latent variable `C` influences `A` and `B`: `C -> A` and `C -> B`.  So directly changing `A` won't directly change `B`. 

However, for most things, I think we usually know a `C` or a set of potential things that could be `C` that we can try to change in order to affect both `A` and `B`. 

For example, in life, if you know you're weak at relationships (i.e. `A`) and you know that good relationships correlate with life satisfaction (i.e. `B`) then you can probably think of a handful of things you could be doing to improve your social or relationship skills (i.e. `C`). 

It could be that improving your social skills itself is what really increases your life satisfaction (`C -> B`). But, after the fact, does it really matter whether it was that skill improvement or the better relationships (`A`)? Either way, you're more satisfied.
