Talent is that which is built-in and not under our control. 

And everything else is everything else. That is, everything that 
we can't control. 

The tricky bit is that we can't tell easily which is which, even
if we look at the science. 

The nature vs nuture question, insofar as the question is 
interested in delineating which factors we control over the
course of our lifetimes and which ones we do not, is far from 
answered. 

And in the ways it is answered, it is so unsatisfactorily.

We get certain percentages of genetic influence and certain percentages
environmental, etc, etc. But these are static pictures of populations. 
They speak nothing of individual dynamics over time courses. 

[Although biological/biomedical research hasn't gotten there yet, b/c 
it's a more difficult problem to address, it will soon with all of this 
"precision medicine"/ "clinical trials of one" hoopla.]

But I digress. The point is we don't/can't know for sure right now. 

And so assuming we are well-to-do humans who want the best outcome for our 
lives and (and please note, this second piece is actually a fairly big assumption 
that people might have some degree of issue with) are willing to work hard to 
be good at the things under our control (since presumably better outcomes are
produced from being good, which is produced by work), how do we (best) proceed? 

Well, let's look at our options (or, more precisely a discrete view of
the spectrum of our options) briefly, we can choose to believe: 

(a) nothing is under our control.  
(b) few things are under our control.  
(c) few things are outside our control.  
(d) nothing is outside our control.  
(e) a mixture of (a)/(b) and (c)/(d).  

Probably, (e) is the closest to reality and what we all take to be true
most of the time. But would we lose something in believing (e)?

Sure, b/c we could mistake some things that are inside our control as
being outside (False Negatives; Type II Error). This is bad, we don't 
want this. It would eliminate an opportunity for us to achieve better 
outcomes in those things. 

And we would also mistake things that are outside our control as
being inside (False Positives; Type I Error). This isn't good either. Now
we end up wasting energy working at things that are outside our control 
(and we wouldn't get anywhere).

So, let's consider the others. What do we lose in believing (a)? 

Eh... everything. Basically, anything inside our control is ignored. And 
we stay weak, our softness, instead of being sweat out, remains in our bones. 

What about (d), what do we lose in believing (d)? 

Well, everything that is outside of our control becomes a false positive. And
so we work at a number of things that we cannot change. This isn't ideal b/c
we'd waste a considerable amounts of energy working on things that don't
change. 

So then it comes down to (b) and (c). 

And here I have to appeal to a philosophy (and rightly so since philosophy is
the study-of/exposition-on those areas of human inquiry that are at this time 
vague), I would much rather invest more work to ensure that I catch all those 
areas that are under my control and result in more false positives, than work 
less and risk false negatives. 

But then maybe someone argues: ok, well then, it seems like you just want it more
and are willing to work for it more, which may be a feature outside of your control.
(This goes back to the do-gooders will work hard assumption.) But who's to say that 
your wanting-it-more isn't in fact under your control? Can you control how much you
want something? This reminds of the question of free will. 

Well, I'd argue again that this property of "wanting it enough" will also
have to be labeled "outside" or "inside" control and so the question actually 
remains unchanged. Its scope just broads. (And in fact this is an illustrative
example where it's tricky discerning what is/is-not under your control.)

So (c) is becomes, folks. Work hard. Don't doubt it's under your control, unless
there's unequivocal/clear evidence to the contrary (as to not waste energy).
Believe in choice/free will, at all levels. 

Out.
