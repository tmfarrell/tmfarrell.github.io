*This is a very informal preliminary argument about constructing a classification space of
knowledge/ endevour.*

## Space 

Y-axis: Density $$ \forall $$ Dispersity  
X-axis: Formality \\(\Longleftrightarrow\\) Informality  
Z-axis: Constructive/ Engineering \\(\Longleftrightarrow\\) Deconstructive/ Science  

## Density 

Density. The amount of information/ entropy (across time and space) in some piece 
of knowledge, in whatever medium it's manifested.

For instance, consider an equilibrium constant \\(K_a\\) for some chemical equation. 
Then consider the equation for the relationship between free energy and equilibrium constants. 
Which has more information/ entropy? 

The latter seems to, because it refers to the behavior of all equilibrium constants and reactions. 
But really, it only applies to the numbers that describe those reactions. The numbers 
themselves don't take up much space *in bits* (and don't have that much entropy). The former is 
actually much more dense b/c it refers to the behavior of all instances of that particular reaction,
which depending on the reaction may be incredibly ubiquitous. 

Then, after quantifying the information it contains, the density can computed by divided by that 
number by the volume in bits of that knowledge representation. In this way, density is akin to a 
kind of data compression. 

## Formality 

Formality. The degree to which statements of knowledge hold true under some system of logic. 

Formality essentially is the degree to which statements can be, or are capable of being, proven. For 
instance, there may be a great number of statements that *claim* to be very dense---to explain the 
nature of physics with a unifying equation, for instance---but cannot necessarily be proven under a 
system of (usually agreed-upon) logic. 

And formality doesn't necessarily imply density, b/c some very formal statements may only apply to other 
formal statements, which may not themselves be very much information. 

Informal statements of knowledge are those that don't manifest themselves under a system of logic. 
Some of these statements claim to be true, but they need to be *formalized* in order to be proven so. 

## Constructive

Constructive. To build statements of knowledge/ endevour anew from logic or materials, for the 
purposes of density/ work/ utility/ value. (This is engineering.) 

To deconstruct means to take apart, to reduce, into materials or less dense statements, usually for the 
purposes of knowledge. (This is science.)

Constructive can mean both actively building something physical, or the writing describing the building 
of something. But the degree to which some action is constructive is the degree to which the building 
actually manipulates physical matter. 

In the case of writing, it is much less constructive because it doesn't actually construct something 
physical, it only puts ink stains on a page. Though it is still constructive, and actually is does depend 
on the nature of the writing. With certain endevours (ahem, software writing), the writing does have 
consequences that may manipulate a good deal of physical matter and thus may be more constructive than 
building physical structure. 

Construction has to do with the amount of physical matter it has actively reordered or has, as product 
of its function, reordered (say, a robot on some assembly line).
