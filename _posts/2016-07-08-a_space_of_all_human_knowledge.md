*This is a very informal preliminary argument about constructing a classification space of
knowledge/ endevour.*

## Space 

Y-axis: Density \\(\Longleftrightarrow\\) Dispersity  
X-axis: Formality \\(\Longleftrightarrow\\) Informality  
Z-axis: Constructive/ Engineering \\(\Longleftrightarrow\\) Deconstructive/ Science  

## Density 

Density. The amount of information/ entropy (across time and space) in some piece 
of knowledge, in whatever medium it's manifested.

For instance, consider an equilibrium constant \\(K_a\\) for some ubiquitous chemical equation. 
Then consider the equation for the relationship between free energy and equilibrium constants. 
First, which has more information/ entropy? 

The latter seems to, because it refers to the behavior of all equilibrium constants and reactions. 
But really, it really only applies to the numbers that describe those reactions. The numbers 
themselves don't take up much space *in bits* (and don't have that much entropy). The former is 
actually much more dense b/c it refers to the behavior of all instances of that particular reaction 
(across space and time), which depending on the reaction may be incredibly ubiquitous. 

Then, after quantifying the information it contains, the density can computed by divided by the 
space (in bits) that that piece of knowledge occupies (i.e. how much memory it would take to store
it).

## Formality 

Formality. The degree to which statements of knowledge hold true under some system of logic. 

Formality essentially is the degree to which statements can or are proven. For instance, there
may be a great number of statements that *claim* to be very dense---to explain the nature of 
physics with a unifying equation, for instance---but cannot necessarily be proven under a system
of (usually agreed-upon) logic. 

And formality doesn't necessarily imply density, b/c some very formal statements may only apply to other 
formal statements, which may not themselves be very much information. 

Informal statements of knowledge are those that don't manifest themselves under a system of logic. 
Sometimes they claim to be true but they need to be *formalized* in order to be proven so. 

## Constructive

Constructive. To build statements of knowledge/ endevour anew from logic or materials, for the 
purposes of density/ work/ utility/ value. (This is engineering.) 

To deconstruct means to take apart, to reduce, into materials or less dense statements, usually for the 
purposes of knowledge. (This is science.)

Constructive can mean both actively building something physical, or the act of writing about building 
something, or the writing describing the building of something. But it is the degree to which the building
actually shapes physical matter. 

In the case of writing, the statements happen to be more dense because the take much less data, then 
say the description of the human (or machine) actually building the thing; but it is much less 
constructive because it doesn't actually construct something physical. Construction has to do with the 
amount of physical matter it has actively reordered or has, as product of its function, reordered (say, 
a robot on some assembly line).
