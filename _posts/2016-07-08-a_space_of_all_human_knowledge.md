*This is a very informal preliminary argument about constructing a classification space of
knowledge/ endevour.*

## Space 

Y-axis: Density \\(\Longleftrightarrow\\) Dispersity  
X-axis: Formality \\(\Longleftrightarrow\\) Informality  
Z-axis: Constructive/ Engineering \\(\Longleftrightarrow\\) Deconstructive/ Science  

## Density 

The amount of entropy/ information (across time and space) "contained" in a piece of 
knowledge per bit of information in the medium it's manifested.

Basically, it's data compression. Divide the amount of information in the description of a system
by the entropy of that described system.<sup id="a1">[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression)</sup>

## Formality 

The degree to which statements of knowledge are shown to follow from a certain set of axioms under a defined set
of rules. Insofar as the axioms and rules are stated and shown to lay the foundation for the asserted statement,
the statement is formal; insofar as they are not stated and not shown to follow, the statement is informal.

Formality is a property of the language used. Insofar as the language used can be type-checked, that is shown to
follow from some axioms according to some rules, the language is formal. Insofar as it can't it's informal. 

And formality can be quantified through some sort of static analysis of statements, where the statements
are taken as programs and type-checked. And the degree of formality can be taken to be the concentration of formal,
as opposed to informal, language used. 

## Constructive

To build statements from materials/ information for the purposes of density or formality. This is engineering. 
To deconstruct, to take apart, to reduce, into materials or less dense statements. This is science.

The degree to which some procedures/ processes are constructive is the degree to which that process changes
the density of the space upon which it acts; the degree to which it produces some large \\(\Delta\delta\\), 
where \\(\delta\\) density and \\(\Delta\delta = \delta_f - \delta_i\\). To make statements (or actual physical 
structures) more dense and less dispersed is constructive and results in positive change. To make statements/ 
structures less dense and more dispersed is deconstructive and results in negative change. 

Deconstruction is science and construction is engineering. Science's main aim is to reduce systems and 
statements down to their essential parts, to decompose them into tautologies. Engineering's main aim is to 
pack statements/ parts into a small space in well-designed way. Design is a packing problem; a question of
allocating space.
