Came across this excerpt in the intro to David Hume's **Treatise on Human Nature**. He's got a great point here, one that scientists/ engineers/ technical-types sometimes forget.

>It is evident, that all the sciences have a relation, greater or less, to human nature: and that however wide any of them may seem to run from it, they still return back by one passage or another. Even Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Natural Religion, are in some measure dependent on the science of MAN; since they lie under the cognizance of men, and are judged of by their powers and faculties. It is impossible to tell what changes and improvements we might make in these sciences were we thoroughly acquainted with the extent and force of human understanding, and could explain the nature of the ideas we employ, and of the operations we perform in our reasonings. 

Indeed, the practice of math/science/technology is indeed inherently a product of human nature. And there are two angles/points here.  


First, I think from this (Hume's) perspective it could be argued math/sci/tech is the *most human* product of our nature. Our capacity for higher order reason, which finds its pinnacle in the labs and office of math/sci/tech, is what sets us apart.<sup>[1](#f1)</sup> It's the reason for our dominance as a species. 

We have the ability to develop language that describes the order of Nature, by testing, trying and iterating it over time. We have the ability to use the resulting language to rearrange this Natural order to do our bidding. 

No other species has this ability. 

Some may have ability for non-verbal language and pheromone communication and sight and aerobic respiration, but none have the ability for the higher order piece. 

So, as it turns out, math/sci/tech may not be as cold-calculating or inhuman as it's usually advertised to be. To think in these terms may be more central to being human than anything else. 


Second, from this same perspective, it's true also that we're still very primitive. We're still a stones throw away from being bonobos, and so we shouldn't fully trust ourselves.  

We should remember that our language is far from bulletproof, and in many ways weak/insufficient. (This should be obvious to most mathematicians at this point. Incompleteness, anyone?) Objects and rules of nature are better. 

We should remember that there are no panceas or perfect technologies; however much they are touted such. There is no solution that cannot be improved upon or found wanting. It's all primitive in a way. 

We should remember that after all we are operating on hard/software that is highly complicated and dynamic. And also old and maybe in need of a bit of updating. (And we know this. This is why we educate.)

<a name="f1">1</a>: Some might argue that philosophy or the humanities is what sets us apart. I think it's hard to argue against math/sci/tech as the culmination of human thought. What has had more influence on our fitness as a species than physics?
