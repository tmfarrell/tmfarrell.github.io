> Ne te quaesiveris extra. 
> - Ralph Waldo Emerson, *Self-Reliance* 

> Man is his own star; and the soul that can  
> Render an honest and a perfect man,  
> Commands all light, all influence, all fate;  
> Nothing to him falls early or too late.  
> Our acts our angels are, or good or ill,  
> Our fatal shadows that walk by us still.
> - John Fletcher, *An Honest Man's Fortune* 


I've always been drawn to the opening quote of Ralph Waldo Emerson's <a href="https://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/SAYLOR-ENGL405-1.2.3.pdf">__Self-Reliance__</a>, which translated from Latin to English: *Do not seek outside yourself.*

And I think this is quite literally how things really work. We can't seek outside ourselves for anything because, by definition, the way we interact with the world is through our subjective self. In this way, there is *nothing* that we can do without first going through our selves. 

To be clear, I'm not saying that we can affect reality and change the world for the better. To the contrary, I believe we are the biological organisms most well equipped to understand and change/ update the objective environment. 

However, in order to do this most effectively, we must realize that it is impossible to do this without first passing through your subjective experience, which by definition is non-objective and specific to the peculiarities of your neurobiology/ chemistry. 

So what we need to do then is get really in tune with our subjectivities (the self-talk, the self-doubt, the emotions, etc.), our specific peculiarities, in order to control/ adjust them. 

In addition, I think another obvious implication of this is, similar to how the old adage goes: if you want anything done, you've go to do it through your self. Especially if what you want done relates directly to your own life. Though, again, even if it doesn't relate directly, everything does relate to your life *indirectly* since you're experiencing everything through your self.    

Bottom line: Things don't happen to you. You act, as subject, and the objective world changes. If the changes you see in the objective world are not to your liking, or in accordance with your goals, then you have to change how you, as a subject, act. In this sense (and I think in a very real sense), everything is a (direct or indirect) result of your actions. 

Now, of course, I'm not saying that there aren't things outside of your control, since clearly to make that argument in our very complicated, modern world would be absurd. But I'd push back on anyone who argues that it's difficult to make change in the world. Have they tried? If so, how *hard* have they tried *really*? How *long* have they tried *really*? Making change, especially on ambitious goals, is difficult but you don't how difficult and it could be much easier than anticipated with the right mindset. I think often people underestimate how much is possible simply b/c they frame things as __being done to them__ rather than __results, direct or indirect, of their actions__.  

Now, I'm not saying that anyone can change anything in the objective world over any given time period. Again, these things are difficult, especially for problems that are known to be so. But by focusing on the pieces of reality that are and are not under your control, and which ones (from a time management perspective) give the best cost-benefit, breaks big problems into small bits that can be directly in your sphere of influence. 

In the end, you as a subject must make these determinations and, upon making them, adjust your actions to invoke positive change.
