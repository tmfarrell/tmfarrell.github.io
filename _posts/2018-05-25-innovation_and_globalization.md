In [Zero to One](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296), 
Peter Thiel's manifest on startups and the future, he argues that *innovation*---doing/ 
creating something new---is fundamentally more important than *globalization*---implementing/ 
copying in other places what has been shown to work in innovation centers.  

One of his main arguments is that globalization focuses on dis/replacing workers 
with automation, while innovation focuses on complementing workers with it.  In the 
first place, I'm not sure this is true. And, in the second place, even if it is, 
it still seems uncompelling. 

He had a few other arguments for why innovation > globalization, but I don't recall
him giving a simple, clear argument that was obviously true.  To be clear, 
I think he is right.  It does seem that innovation is more important than 
globalization, but I'm not exactly sure why.   

## A Rough Estimate  

Let's talk about what innovation and globalization are more precisely. These
aren't discrete categories, but rather continuous quantities: some activities
are more globalizing/ spreading and some are more innovating/ advancing.  But any 
given activity seems to have properties of both spreading and advancing.  The 
question then is: what does this space of spreading/ advancing activities look like? 

Say you wanted to quantify the potential utility of two different
activities---one globalizing \\(A\\), one innovating \\(B\\)---so you could decide 
which to devote your time to. A useful estimate might be: 

\\[ U_{gain} \propto t_{gain} \times u_{gain} \times n \\]

Where \\( t_{gain} \\) is the time gained from your doing this activity now, versus
others doing this activity later. Or: 

\\[ t_{gain} = t_{others} - t_{you} \\]

And \\( u_{gain} \\) is the per person per unit time gain in utility over someone
else's work/ product. Or: 

\\[ u_{gain} = u_{you} - u_{others} \\]

And \\( n \\) is the number of persons affected/ impacted by your work/ product, 
which we'll call scale. 

So, then, \\( U_{gain} \\) is the overall utility gained from your doing/ producing
your work/ product at some time \\( t_{you} \\) with some utility \\( u_{you} \\). 
This is a useful estimation space for innovation and globalization, because it 
immediately suggests what factors innovation and globalization focus on maximizing. 

Primarily, innovation is concerned with increasing \\(t_{gain}\\) and \\(u_{gain}\\). 
You want to do things earlier than everyone else, and/or at the very least way 
better than has been done recently.  Ideally, you want \\(t_{gain}\\) to be at least 
a couple years and \\(u_{gain}\\) to be at least 3-10 times \\(u_{others}\\).  This 
is the space of innovation. 

Globalization is primarily (maybe even chiefly) concerned with increasing \\(n\\). 
You can do this by decreasing the cost of delivering \\(u_{gain}\\), thereby freeing
up more capital to increase production of more \\(u_{gain}\\) for more \\(n\\). Or 
more commonly by increasing the locations at which you offer \\(u_{gain}\\), 
thereby increasing demand for \\(n\\). 

## Area under a Curve

Ok, so the above estimation seems kind of useful. But can we do better? 

There are a few assumptions built into this estimator that are less than ideal.  First, 
it assumes you do things earlier than others, which isn't the case for globalizing
activities.  It also assumes you do things better, which may also not be true of 
globalizing activities (whose quality might be compromised at the expense of increasing 
quantity).  All of which don't work because \\( U_{gain} < 0 \\) isn't useful for this 
sort of calculation/ estimation. 

Another unrealistic assumption of this equation is that \\(n\\) and \\(u\\) don't 
change over \\(t_{gain}\\), which definitely shouldn't be the case if you and/or your 
company are improving their work/products over time.  And this is quite important 
for quantifying innovative activities that are (or are supposed to be) high growth.  

A more accurate representation would be the following:    

\\[ U \propto \int_{t_{i}}^{t_{f}} u(t) \ast n(t)   dt \\]

Where \\(u(t)\\) and \\(n(t)\\) are the utility and scale functions of your work/ product 
at some time \\(t\\). 

So \\(U\\) then would be true overall utility of your work/ product over some time period \\(t_i\\)
to \\(t_f\\), which is more realistically how things work. 

## Innovation > Globalization? 

So what about those two activities we wanted to decide between? You would compute \\(U_A\\)
and \\(U_B\\) and if \\(U_A > U_B\\) do \\(A\\), otherwise do \\(B\\).

The point is: **you have to do the math**. You'll inevitably have to do some guesstimation
to get at these values, but it's much better than just saying innovation > globalization in
all cases.  It's not that simple. 

That said, though, if you're similar to me (i.e. live in an American city, particularly a hub
of innovation), then more likely than not it will much easier to achieve higher 
\\(u_{gain}\\) and \\(t_{gain}\\) than anywhere else.  We have access to the most cutting-edge 
science and technology.  And probably even greater access to capital to increase \\(n\\) over 
time. The environment is conducive to innovating over globalizing.  

And this also implies some facts about choosing to pursue globalizing activities.  If you want 
to achieve very high \\(n\\), you must have access to resources and systems sufficient to 
achieve this scale. This doesn't happen overnight.  

If you want to engage/impact globalizing activities meaningfully, you have to join a company with 
established resources.  A company which has its own agenda and many other individuals.  In this case, 
your contribution would be diluted (i.e. \\(u_{you}\\) would be some fraction \\(\alpha\\) of the 
company's \\(u_{company}\\) where \\(\alpha\\) small), much more so that if you were a part of an innovative 
company, which would likely be smaller (and so \\(\alpha\\) bigger).  If you could obtain a 
highly influential position in such a company, though, then you could increase your \\(\alpha\\) to 
the point where \\(\alpha u_{company} \ast n \\) might be comparable to your working at a start-up,
if their \\(n\\) is sufficiently small.
