I believe the application of engineering to biology and medicine is the next big phase in technological progress, and will ultimately transform human health and longevity. I also believe that leveraging [computer and data science will be critical for this transformation](https://a16z.com/2017/06/21/jorge-conde-bio-fund/).

I'm here to help achieve that vision.

I write here occasionally to make sense of things. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:tfarrell01@gmail.com) with feedback or comments.
