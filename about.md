Biomedical/ bioinformatics engineer operating in Boston. 

My interests lie at the intersection of engineering, biomedicine and
computation. Though my latest work is mostly computational, I'm equally 
interested in wetwork. (Mainly I want to make biostuff that is useful and works.)

I use this to write meaningfully about things I read/ think. 

Feel free to [contact me](tfarrell01@gmail.com) with comments/ feedback.  

<!--
Along with standard links to professional info and (oft-neglected)
social media, you'll find here writings on various topics that I 
think about. Sometimes these discuss specific ideas related to
my work (at the intersection of computation, engineering and biology/
medicine). Often however they deal more abstractly in math, 
technology and science; as writing "generally" seems to help develop/
solidify ideas "specifically" (probably due somehow with  
<a href="link">this</a>).

<!--
If I was in the manner of giving a name to this <strike>blog</strike>
set of writings, it might be called "of measure and machine". Or just
as easily "portraits by an (bio)engineer as a young man". Or probably
some other equally arbitrary/gratuitous set of strings, meant to rapture 
souls and convey intelligent coolness. Ado, I am not. As such you'll have
to take this/ these for exactly what's written, not what's advertised.
