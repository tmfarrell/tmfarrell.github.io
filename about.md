(Biomedical Automation/Data | Bioinformatics) Engineer operating in Boston.  

My interests lie at the intersection of computation/automation, engineering 
and biomedicine. My latest work has been mostly computational/software-related; 
however, I'm equally interested in wetwork/hardware (and have experience there). 
Mainly, I want to make "biostuff", not specific to any one level of the biological 
hiearchy, that works and is useful.

I use this to write meaningfully about things I read/ think.

<!--
Along with standard links to professional info and (oft-neglected)
social media, you'll find here writings on various topics that I 
think about. Sometimes these discuss specific ideas related to
my work (at the intersection of computation, engineering and biology/
medicine). Often however they deal more abstractly in math, 
technology and science; as writing "generally" seems to help develop/
solidify ideas "specifically" (probably due somehow with  
<a href="link">this</a>).

<!--
If I was in the manner of giving a name to this <strike>blog</strike>
set of writings, it might be called "of measure and machine". Or just
as easily "portraits by an engineer (bioengineer) as a young man". Or probably
some other equally gratuitous set of strings, meant to rapture 
souls and convey some intelligent sort of coolness. Ado, I'm not. You'll have
to take this/ these for exactly what's written, not what's advertised.
