<p>
Name's Tim Farrell. I'm a biomedical/ bioinformatics engineer/ guy, 
operating in Boston. I'm interested in the intersectino of engineering,
computation and biomedicine. But mostly I just want to make things that 
work, in silico && in vivo.

<p> 
I recently graduated and am currently on an OCONUS mission with my 
Army Reserve unit. I will be seeking employment upon return in 2017.

Along with standard links to professional info and (oft-neglected)
social media, you'll find here writings on various topics that I 
think about. Sometimes these discuss specific ideas related to
my work (at the intersection of computation, engineering and biology/
medicine). Often however they deal more abstractly in math, 
technology and science; as writing "generally" seems to help develop/
solidify ideas "specifically" (probably due somehow with  
<a href="link">this</a>).

<!--<p>
If I was in the manner of giving a name to this <strike>blog</strike>
set of writings, it might be called "of measure and machine". Or just
as easily "portraits by an (bio)engineer as a young man". Or probably
other equally gratuitous strings, meant to rapture souls and convey 
intelligence and coolness. Ado, I am not. As such you'll have to take
this/ these for exactly what's written, not what's advertised.
