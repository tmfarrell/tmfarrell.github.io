I believe the application of engineering to biology and medicine is the next big phase in technological progress, and will ultimately transform human health and longevity. I also believe that leveraging computation and data will be critical for this transformation.

I'm here to help achieve this vision.

I write here occasionally to make sense of things. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:tfarrell01@gmail.com) with feedback or comments.
