(Biomedical Automation/Data | Bioinformatics) Engineer operating in Boston.  

My interests lie at the intersection of computation/automation, engineering 
and biomedicine. My latest work has been mostly computational/software-related; 
however, I'm equally interested in wetwork/hardware (and have experience there). 
Mainly, I want to make "biostuff", not specific to any one level of the
<a href="">biological hierarchy</a>, that works and is useful.

I use this to write meaningfully about things I read/ think. 

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:tfarrell01@gmail.com) with comments/ feedback.
