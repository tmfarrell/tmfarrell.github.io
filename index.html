			<p>
			That was all of tangible things; but in memories we were rich. We had pierced the veneer of outside things. We had “suffered, starved and triumphed, <br/>
			groveled down yet grasped as glory, grown bigger in the bigness of the whole. We had seen God in all of his splendors, heard the text that Nature <br/>
			renders.” We had reached the naked soul of man. <br />
